# Normalization

## First Normal Form - 1NF

**Rules of First Normal Form**:

"_When converted into relational schema, all attribute must contain atomic values. ie, it shouldn't be divisible into smaller parts_"

If composite attributes exist, convert them into their respective column.

If multiple attruibutes exits in a single column, make two tuples for them

"_A column must contain vaules from the same domain_"

"_Each column name must be unique_"

"_No ordering to the rows & coulmns_"

"_No Duplicate Rows must exist_"

Note: when an ER diagram is converted into relational schema, it will automatically be in First Normal Form
