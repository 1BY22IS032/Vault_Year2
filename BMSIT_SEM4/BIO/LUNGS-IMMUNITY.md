# Immune System

## Introduction

The lungs play a crucial role in the body's immune defense system. They contain several types of immune cells that work together to protect against pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi

- Crucial Role in immune defense
- contains different types of immune cells 

## Macrophages

- Alveolar Macrophages :
  - Primary immune cells;
  - surface of the alveoli;
  - digesting pathogens,deadcells and debris;
  - release cytokines which send an alarm to other cells;

- Interstitial Macrophages:
  - Found within lung tissue itself
  - Process and present antigen to other immune cells

## Lymphocytes

- T CELLS:
  - Type of WBC
  - Helper T : release cytokines
  - Cytotoxic T : kill infected cells by recognizing pathogenic antigen
  - Regulatory T: Modulate immune response to avoid excessive inflammation

- B CELLS:
  - Produces Antibodies that neutralize pathogens

## Dendritic Cells

- Capture pathogenic cells and present the antigen to T Cells
- play a imp role in dealing with inhaled pathogens

## Mechanism

1. Phagocytosis : consumption and elimination of Pathogenic cells by Macrophages and Lyphocytes
2. Antigen Presentation : Dendritic and Macrophages present Antigen to T cells which initiates immune response
3. Cytokine production : Cytokines are released as an alarm to other immune cells
4. AntiBody Production : B cells take in the antigen and produce necesarry Antibodies that kill the infected cells /pathogens
