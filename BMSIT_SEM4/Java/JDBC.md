# JDBC

## Steps in JDBC

### Detailed Steps

1. **Load the JDBC Driver**:
   - The JDBC driver is a set of classes that implement the JDBC interfaces to communicate with the database.
   - Use `Class.forName()` to load the driver class dynamically at runtime. This step ensures that the driver is registered with the `DriverManager`.

2. **Establish a Connection**:
   - Use `DriverManager.getConnection()` to establish a connection to the database.
   - Provide the database URL, username, and password.
   - The connection URL format is typically `jdbc:<subprotocol>://<host>:<port>/<database>`.

3. **Create a Statement**:
   - Use the `Connection.createStatement()` method to create a `Statement` object.
   - This object will be used to send SQL statements to the database.

4. **Execute the Query**:
   - Use the `Statement.executeQuery()` method to execute a SQL SELECT query.
   - This method returns a `ResultSet` object that contains the data produced by the query.

5. **Process the Results**:
   - Iterate through the `ResultSet` to retrieve the data.
   - Use methods like `getInt()`, `getString()`, etc., to extract values from the `ResultSet`.

6. **Close the Resources**:
   - It is crucial to close the `ResultSet`, `Statement`, and `Connection` objects to free up database resources.
   - Use `close()` method to close these objects in the reverse order of their creation.

```java
import java.sql.*;

public class JdbcExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    
        Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");
        (Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb", "username", "password");
        Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
        ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT id, name FROM users")) {
        while (rs.next()) {
            System.out.println("ID: " + rs.getInt("id") + ", Name: " + rs.getString("name"));
        }
        }
    }
}
```

## JDBC Drivers 

Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) provides a standard Java API for database-independent connectivity between the Java programming language and a wide range of databases. There are four types of JDBC drivers, each serving different purposes and architectures:

### 1. Type-1 Driver (JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver)

- **Description**: This driver acts as a bridge between JDBC and ODBC. It converts JDBC method calls into ODBC function calls.
- **Architecture**:
  - Java application -> JDBC API -> JDBC-ODBC Bridge -> ODBC API -> Database.
- **Advantages**:
  - Allows access to almost any database since most databases support ODBC.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Performance overhead due to the conversion of JDBC calls to ODBC calls.
  - Requires ODBC installation on the client machine.
  - Not suitable for web applications because of client-side ODBC installation requirements.
- **Usage**:
  - Generally used for prototyping and in environments where an ODBC driver is already available.

### 2. Type-2 Driver (Native-API Driver)

- **Description**: This driver converts JDBC calls into database-specific native API calls.
- **Architecture**:
  - Java application -> JDBC API -> Native API (via driver) -> Database.
- **Advantages**:
  - Better performance than Type-1 since it uses native API calls.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires native database client libraries to be installed on the client machine.
  - Database-specific, hence not portable across different databases.
- **Usage**:
  - Used in applications where performance is critical and the client environment is controlled.

### 3. Type-3 Driver (Network Protocol Driver)

- **Description**: This driver translates JDBC calls into a database-independent network protocol, which is then translated to a database-specific protocol by a server.
- **Architecture**:
  - Java application -> JDBC API -> Middleware server -> Database.
- **Advantages**:
  - No need for native database client libraries on the client machine.
  - Database-independent, providing good portability.
  - Suitable for internet-based applications where the database server is remote.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Performance can be slower than Type-2 drivers due to the extra network round-trip.
  - Requires the middleware server to handle the communication.
- **Usage**:
  - Ideal for internet applications and enterprise applications with a multi-tier architecture.

### 4. Type-4 Driver (Thin Driver)

- **Description**: This driver converts JDBC calls directly into the database-specific protocol. It is entirely written in Java and communicates directly with the database.
- **Architecture**:
  - Java application -> JDBC API -> Database-specific protocol -> Database.
- **Advantages**:
  - Best performance since it eliminates the need for native libraries and additional network round-trips.
  - Pure Java implementation, making it platform-independent and suitable for both client and server environments.
  - Easy to deploy and maintain.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Database-specific, requiring different drivers for different databases.
- **Usage**:
  - Widely used in production environments due to its performance and ease of deployment.
