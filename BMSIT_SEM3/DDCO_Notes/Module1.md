## Definition of binary logic

|name|Logic|Symbol|Example|
|:-------:|:-------:|:--------:|:--------:|
|**AND**|Multiplicator|(.)or empty|1 . 1 = 1 or 1 . 0 = 0|
|**OR**|Addition|(+)|1 + 0 = 1 or 0 + 0 = 0|
|**NOT**|Complement|(`)or overbar|1~ = 0  or  0~ = 1|

## Boolean Algebra And Logic Gates

### Duality

One part may be obtained from the other if the binary operators and the identity elements are interchanged.

>This important property of Boolean algebra is called
the duality principle and states that every algebraic expression
deducible from the postulates of Boolean algebra remains valid if
the operators and identity elements are interchanged

If the dual of an algebraic expression is desired, we
simply interchange OR and AND operators and replace 1’s by 0’s
and 0’s by 1’s
