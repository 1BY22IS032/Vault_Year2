# Data Structures

## Define Data structures. Explain in detail different types of data structures with neat diagram and its operations

Data structures are organized ways to store and manage data.

**Types of data structures**:

1. Linear
2. Non Linear DS

**Linear**:
in linear all the values are ordered next to one another

1. Arrays:
   1. Definition : ordered collection of elements defined around an index
   2. Operations: Access, insertion,deletion and traversal
2. Linked Lists:
   1. Definition:A collection of elements called nodes with each node consisting of a data part and a link that points to the next node
   2. Types : singly linked list, doubly linked lists and circular linked lists
   3. Operations: Insertion, deletion, traversal, searching
3. Stacks:
   1. Last In First Out methodology
   2. Operations:PUSH,POP,PEEK
4. Queues:
   1. First In First Out Methodology
   2. Types : Queues, Double ended Queues, Circular Queues
   3. Operations:EnQueue, DeQueue

**Non Linear DS**:

1. Trees:
   1. Trees are hierarchical structures with a root node and child nodes forming a parent-child relationship
   2. Types: Binary tree, binary search tree, AVL tree, B-tree, etc.
   3. Operations: Insertion, deletion, traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order)
2. Graphs
   1. Definition: Graphs are collections of nodes (vertices) connected by edges
   2. Types: Directed graph (digraph), undirected graph, weighted graph, unweighted graph
   3. Operations: Insertion, deletion, traversal (depth-first search, breadth-first search), finding shortest path
3. Hash Tables
   1. Hash tables store key-value pairs and use a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets from which the desired value can be found
   2. Operations : Insertion Deletion Search

**Operations on Data Structures**:

1. Insertion
2. Deletion
3. Traversal
4. Searching
5. Sorting
